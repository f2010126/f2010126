- 👋 Hi, I’m @f2010126. Dipti for daily use. :)
- 👀 I’m interested in: creating things. I've worked on Networks, Databases, Frontend, UI/UX design, and quite a lot of Machine Learning. I also like to cook, dance and organise events in my free time.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React, Zero Shot Machine Learning Models, Salsa, Bachata, Kizomba and baking breads. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a new job after graduation, a new recipe or even a new dance routine.
- 📫 How to reach me : Via LinkedIn (rare), Instagram (@insane_gupta).
